🧵 About Heritage Handloom

Heritage Handloom is an initiative to preserve and promote India’s rich weaving culture by directly connecting traditional artisans with customers.
Handloom weaving is not just a craft — it is a legacy passed through generations, representing our history, culture, and identity.
However, many skilled weavers struggle due to lack of digital market presence and middlemen who reduce their earnings.

This platform aims to empower artisans by providing them an online marketplace where they can showcase their handmade products.
